======================

Purpose
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Boko-Maru is general-use pipeline for reducing and analyzing spectroscopic time series.
It is intended for mainly two science applications: spectra of transiting exoplanets and rotating brown dwarfs.
It will work on JWST NIRCam data, HST grism data and ground-based spectra (such as IRTF SpeX data).

Under Construction Warning: Work-in-Progress
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This project started with documentation first, so the functionality described in documentation likely hasn't finished or even been started!
